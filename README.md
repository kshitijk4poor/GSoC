## Summary
[Artemis](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis) is a modular vulnerability scanner by CERT PL. It's the tool that powers CERT PL's scanning activities by checking various aspects of website security and building easy-to-read messages ready to be sent to the scanned organizations.

The aim of the project was to enhance the Artemis scanner by developing new modules for subdomain enumeration and IP/domain validation, and modernizing the user interface. These improvements will boost Artemis's capabilities, efficiency, and user experience.
