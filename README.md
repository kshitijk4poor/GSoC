# GSoC 2024: Extending The Artemis Scanner

## Personal Information

- **GitHub**: [@kshitijk4poor](https://github.com/kshitijk4poor)

## Project Information

- **Organization**: Honeynet
- **Mentors**: [Krzysztof ZajÄ…c](kazet.cc)
- **Project Size**: Large

## Summary
[Artemis](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis) is a modular vulnerability scanner by CERT PL. It's the tool that powers CERT PL's scanning activities by checking various aspects of website security and building easy-to-read messages ready to be sent to the scanned organizations.

The aim of the project was to enhance the Artemis scanner by developing new modules for subdomain enumeration and IP/domain validation, and modernizing the user interface. These improvements will boost Artemis's capabilities, efficiency, and user experience.

## Contributions
### Contributions before GSoC
  - [x] Resolved Windows troubleshooting issues (PR [#827](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/827))
  - [x] Implemented favicon serving (PR [# 864](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/864))
### Proposed Contributions
#### Merged Code
  - [x] Subdomain Enumeration Module (PR [# 1054](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1054))
  - [x] UI revamp (PR [#1197](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1197))
#### Code under review
  - [ ] Domain Validation Function (PR [#1146](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1146))

### Contributions beyond the proposal
  - [x] Enhanced user experience by streamlining Artemis startup process (PR [#1195](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1195))
  - [x] Implemented routine Dependabot dependency upgrades (PR [#1122](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1122))
  - [x] Improved non-x86 Artemis compatibility (PR [#1021](https://github.com/CERT-Polska/Artemis/pull/1021))

## Future Work
I will address the domain validation function in our tests, update the Karton repository to enhance UI/UX coherence, and continue debugging Artemis for improved compatibility with non-x86 machines. My summer work on Artemis was highly productive, and I remain committed to contributing to the project.

## Acknowledgements
I want like to express my gratitude to Google, the honeynet organization and my mentor for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. Krzysztof helped me throughout the coding period, and solved any doubts that I had. he was very supportive and understanding till the end, I really appreciate him for the same and look forward to potential future collaborations.
